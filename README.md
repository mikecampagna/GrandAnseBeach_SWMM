# GrandAnseBeach_SWMM
#### CURRENT MOST UP TO DATE MODEL IS IN "wInfrastructure/Backup"

## Summary

This repository will hold the SWMM model for the Grand Anse Beach region of Grenada. The project will look at a comparison of pre-urbanized undeveloped storm water conditions, and the conditions under the current developed conditions. Recommendations of green storm water infrastructure will then be made and implemented into the model to quantify results.
