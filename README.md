# GrandAnseBeach_SWMM
#### Finsihed models for presentation are located in "FinalModels"

## Summary

This repository will hold the SWMM model for the Grand Anse Beach region of Grenada. The project will look at a comparison of pre-urbanized undeveloped storm water conditions, and the conditions under the current developed conditions. Recommendations of green storm water infrastructure will then be made and implemented into the model to quantify results.

## Stormwater Infrastructure Plan

We ended up using new stormwater infrastructure to divert runoff from the mountains onto the beach away from these flood prone areas. This increased total runoff at these outlets, so GSI was necessary for retention, delay, and minimization of peak outfall flows. This was implemented in the northern end of the beach, the Belmont area.

Camerhogne Park is the only and largest public park in the area, providing beach access to the native Granadians. This park is at risk of being bought by developers for yet another resort. We suggested implementing bio-retention gardens in order to provide yet another function for this park. The result was increased storage, infiltration, evaporation and much less runoff.
